SWF emitter implemented in Rust and Typescript (Node and browser).
Converts [`swf-types` movies][swf-types] to bytes.

- [Rust implementation](./rs/README.md)
- [Typescript implementation](./ts/README.md)

This library is part of the [Open Flash][ofl] project.

## Usage

- [Rust](./rs/README.md#usage)
- [Typescript](./ts/README.md#usage)

## Goal

The goal of this emitter is to enable the manipulation and compilation of SWF
files. For example, the emitter is used by Open Flash to generate test samples.

The emitter guarantees that parsing back the result will return the same AST.
If you find an example where this invariant is broken, please fill an issue:
this is a bug. The same AST always produces the same output.

## Status

The implementation is still incomplete. About half of the tags are supported.

The Typescript implementation is currently ahead of the Rust implementation.
Getting them in sync is part of the current work.

Help is welcome to complete the emitter.
